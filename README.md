# NODEMCU-IN-AP-AND-STA-MODE
A project that programs the NodeMCu in STA and AP mode

## Project Statement
In this project it is required that the NodeMCU should operate in the Access Point mode, where the NodeMCU sets up its own WiFi network and acts as a router for one or more stations, and in the Station mode, where the NodeMCU sets up to an already set up wireless network.
